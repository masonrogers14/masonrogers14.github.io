Hello, my name is Mason Rogers. I am a PhD candidate in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program in physical oceanography under the supervision of Raffaele Ferrari. My current research interests include the structure of the middepth ocean, the overturning circulation, ocean mixing, and the physics of solid particles in flows (e.g. microplastics). I enjoy using analytic and numerical tools to study ocean phenomena.

## Current Projects

#### The middepth ocean

The stratification of the ocean between 1--4 km depth is remarkably horizontally uniform and decays exponentially with depth. Why? More generally, what sets the vertical structure of the deep ocean? [My new paper](https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-22-0225.1) with Raffaele Ferrari (advisor) and Louis-Philippe Nadeau updates classic *[Abyssal](https://doi.org/10.1016/0011-7471(66)90602-4) [Recipes](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0967-0637(98)00070-3)* ideas in light of recent estimates of the abyssal overturning circulation. In doing so, we deduce that the basin-averaged profile of turbulent diffusivity in the Indo-Pacific must decay slowly with height, and we offer a reconciliation between this slowly varying profile and observational evidence of rapidly decaying pointwise mixing profiles. We are continuing this work to develop a robust theory for the middepth ocean.

#### Microplastics

Microplastics are almost everywhere, including in the ocean. Because they are individual solid particles rather than fluid parcels, their equations motion are different from those of a fluid pollutant. When, and to what extent, do these differences matter for microplastics in the ocean? Irina Rypina and I are developing a stochastic model of distributions of marine microplastics to answer these questions.
